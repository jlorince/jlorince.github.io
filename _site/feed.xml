It’s built into Github pages, and let’s you handle all your authoring and updating via Git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I’m really liking it, and setup is pretty simple, espeically if you use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now&quot;&gt;Jekyll Now&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you a template to work off of and handles all the tricky parts of setup. I’m currently running a minimally modified version of the default template, and quite happy with it, though I’ll likely make some more minor changes along the way (and will post about any that are particularly interesting.) This &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/wiki/Adding-Icons&quot;&gt;section of the Jekyll Now wiki&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, was really helpful for getting custom social icons to work properly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary>For anyone who’s been here before, I’ve done a major overhaul of my site design, mainly to facilitate a simple blogging workflow with Jekyll, a markdown-based, static HTML blogging system.

I have no illusions of nor strong desire for major readership, but my hope is that this will help me communicate my work to people who care, and more importantly help me clarify my own ideas as I get them on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I’m excited to say I just accepted a post-doc offer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nico.northwestern.edu/&quot;&gt;NICO&lt;/a&gt; (the Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems), working under Dr. Brian Uzzi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be starting there in Septmeber, so now I can finally stop worrying about jobs and actually try to get my dissertation done. Onward and upward!&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary>After far too long telling my self that I should start “blogging” (shudders), I’m finally convinced that keeping a written log of my activities (predominantly, though not exclusively, research-related) is probably a good idea.
