&lt;p&gt;I’ll be starting there in Septmeber, so now I can finally stop worrying about jobs and actually try to get my dissertation done. Onward and upward!&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary>After far too long telling my self that I should start “blogging” (shudders), I’m finally convinced that keeping a written log of my activities (predominantly, though not exclusively, research-related) is probably a good idea.
