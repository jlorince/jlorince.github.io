I am a joint PhD candidate in cognitive science and psychology, working in the [Adaptive Behavior and Cognition Lab at Indiana University](http://www.indiana.edu/~abcwest/pmwiki/pmwiki.php). I will be starting a post-doctoral fellowship at [NICO](https://www.nico.northwestern.edu/) (the Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems) in September 2016. My work explores human behavior in social information environments on the Web, with a focus on music listening and tagging behavior. I integrate knowledge of human search and decision making capacities with large scale data mining and analysis methods.

Besides being a researcher, I'm immeasurably lucky to be dad to an awesome <strike>baby</strike> toddler and husband to an amazing wife. Those three full-time jobs don't leave too much time left over, but I still try to stay busy as a multi-sport athlete. I spread my time across running, cycling (historically on the road, but in recent years mountain biking has taken priority), and weightlifting. I'm also known to do <a href="https://www.goruck.com/challenge">Goruck challenges</a> from time to time.
