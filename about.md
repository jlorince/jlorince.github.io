I currently work as a Software Engineer at [Narrative Science](https://www.narrativescience.com/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems ([NICO](https://www.nico.northwestern.edu/)) and data scientist at [StumbleUpon](http://www.stumbleupon.com/). My academic research explored human behavior in social information environments on the Web, with a focus on music listening and tagging behavior. I integrate knowledge of human search and decision making capacities with large scale data mining and analysis methods.

Outside of work, I'm immeasurably lucky to be father to two boys and husband to an amazing wife.There's not too much time left over, but I still try to stay busy as a multi-sport athlete. I spread my time across running, cycling and weightlifting. I've also been known to do <a href="https://www.goruck.com/challenge">Goruck challenges</a> from time to time.
