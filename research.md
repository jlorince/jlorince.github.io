## Current projects

<h3><i>Tracking research disciplines on the Web of Science</i></h3>

In this ongoing work, I use a variety of text-mining, machine learning, and related methods to track (and hopefully predict) the popularity of differerent areas of academic research as identified within publications found in the Web of Science. 

<h3><i>Music and gender</i></h3>

This project aims to explore genders differences in patterns of music production and consumption.

## Music listening and tagging patterns on Last.fm
<p>In this research program (my dissertation research) I explore a large-scale dataset from <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a>, including music listening, tagging, social relationships, and more. How do patterns of listening and tagging interact? How do users decide what items to tag and what tags to assign to those items? What heuristic decision-making strategies might drive their behavior in these environments?</p>
<h3 ><i>Music Foraging</i></h3>
<div >
    <p>In my thesis research, I used foraging theory from ecology as a lens to study patterns of music consumption. Foraging animals move from one resource patch to another, exploiting one until doing so becomes less lucrative that setting out in search of a new patch. Is there evidence of such foraging patterns in people's patterns of music listening? What constitutes a "patch" in the high-dimensional space of musical artists? What factors influence listeners' decisions to remain in or move between such patches?</p>

<h3 ><i>Do tags really serve as retrieval aids?</i></h3>
<div >
    <p>In collaborative tagging, it is generally assumed that tags serve a retrieval function, facilitating users' ability to re-find tagged content at a later time. As common as the perspective is, there is practically no empirical evidence supporting it. By examining how music tagging and listening patterns interact, we aim to determine if tagging has a causal impact on future listening, as would be expected if it does in fact facilitate future retrieval.</p>

<h3 ><i>"Supertaggers" and their role in folksonomic systems</i></h3>
<div >
<p>A folksonomy is ostensibly an information structure built up by the "wisdom of the crowd", but is the "crowd" really doing the work? Collaborative tagging is in fact a sharply skewed process in which a small minority of "supertagger" users generate an overwhelming majority of the annotations, and this work explores the implications of this imbalance.</p>

<h2>Personas discovery at StumbleUpon</h2>
 <p>At StumbleUpon, I worked on understanding users' interest profiles, with applications to recommendation and prediction. This involves a combinations of topic modeling and matrix factorization methods for learning user interests, modeling URL topics, and predicting ratings within a unified framework.</p>

<h2>Color preferences of Flickr users</h2>
<p>There is strong evidence that men and women have measurably different color preferences, and a variety of evolutionary accounts for these differences have been proposed. Here we explore whether or not we can find evidence of such differences by analyzing very large datasets of photos from the photo-sharing website Flickr.com.</p>

<h2>Heuristica: A Serious Video Game for Improving Decision Making</h2>
<p>I am a member of a multi-institution team (including IU, <a href="http://www.ara.com/">ARA</a>/<a href="http://www.virtualheroes.com/">Virtual Heroes</a>, and other research groups), working to develop and test a high-fidelity, immersive video game that teaches players to recognize and mitigate negative decision making biases.</p>

<h2>Path Following in Social Web Search</h2>
<p>How can an understanding of path-following in spatial search inform searches in an information space? In this project we studied the sharing of "SearchPaths" (sequences of clicks and queries delineating a trajectory through an information space) between users. In future work, we hope to extend the path-following model other domains, such as music listening and academic paper search.</p>
