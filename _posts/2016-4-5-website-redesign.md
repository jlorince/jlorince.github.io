For anyone who's been here before, I've done a major overhaul of my site design, mainly to facilitate a simple blogging workflow with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a markdown-based, static HTML blogging system. It's built into Github pages, and let's you handle all your authoring and updating via Git.

So far I'm really liking it, and setup is pretty simple, espeically if you use [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), which gives you a template to work off of and handles all the tricky parts of setup. I'm currently running a minimally modified version of the default template, and quite happy with it, though I'll likely make some more minor changes along the way (and will post about any that are particularly interesting.) This [section of the Jekyll Now wiki](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/wiki/Adding-Icons), for instance, was really helpful for getting custom social icons to work properly.
