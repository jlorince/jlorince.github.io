title: New beginnings (at NICO!)
---

After far too long telling my self that I should start "blogging" (*shudders*), I'm finally convinced that keeping a written log of my activities (predominantly, though not exclusively, research-related) is probably a good idea. I have no illusions of nor strong desire for major readership, but my hope is that this will help me communicate my work to people who care, and more importantly help me clarify my own ideas as I get them on the page.

In any case, I'm excited to say I just accepted a post-doc offer at [NICO](https://www.nico.northwestern.edu/) (the Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems), working under Dr. Brian Uzzi.

I'll be starting there in Septmeber, so now I can finally stop worrying about jobs and actually try to get my dissertation done. Onward and upward!
